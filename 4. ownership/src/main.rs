    // 1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.

    // 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    // A data race occurs if we have two pointers pointing to the same piece of data and one of the pointers is used to write to the data and there's no method to syncronize the data access between those pointers.
